# HTML_cert_final_project
### Final project for Framework Television HTML class
#### By Denise Donohue

This is a "Webpage" where users can order the lastest and greatest t-shirts from Tighty Whities!
Of course, we cannot take orders, credit cards, or any type of payment and our address is not exactly real, but that was not the purpose of this project.
This was just a way to learn and utilize HTML and CSS (primarily HTML)

Technologies used: 

* HTML
* CSS


It was a really fun exercise & if you should end up on this page, I do hope you enjoy it!
